The lumpy, spindly universe we see today evolved from a much smoother, infant universe. How this structure formed and the information embedded within is considered one of the “Holy Grails” of modern cosmology, and might hold the key to resolving existing “tensions” in cosmological theory.</p> <p>But how do we go about linking this data to theory ? In this project, my team and I will propose to look at LSS assembled as a <em>graph</em>, and use neural networks to optimally extract information about cosmological parameters (theory) from this representation.</p> <h1 id="cosmology-as-an-optimization-problem">Cosmology as an optimization problem</h1> <p>Large-Scale Structure is <em>large</em>.

Higher order n-point functions can be computed efficiently for clusters, while avoiding the cost of computing extraneous connections across voids. Void catalogues (where edges would correspond to the walls separating the voids) can likewise be assembled into the dual of a halo graph.

We can define a graph as a tuple,</p> <p>\(\begin{equation} G = (\textbf{u}, V, E),\label{eq:graphdef} \end{equation}\) where \(\textbf{u}\) is a global attribute of the graph, i.e. a label or global parameter value and \(E\) and \(V\) are the set of edges and nodes, respectively. The edge set</p> \[E = \{({\bf e}_k, r_k, s_k) \}_{r_k = i, k=1:N^e},\] <p>indexed by \(k=1:N^e\), is comprised of vectors \({\bf e}_k\) of cardinality \(N^e\), which may be directed, connected via receiving and sending indices between nodes, \(r_k\) and \(s_k\). Edges can be equivalently parameterized by an adjacency matrix \(A_{ij}\) in which \(i\) and \(j\) index sender and receiver nodes, respectively. Each node, indexed by \(i=1:N^v\), has a set of edges, \(E_i\), connected to it via a subset of senders and receivers. The full set of nodes is defined as</p> \[V= \{\textbf{v}_i \}_{i=1:N^v},\] <p>where each node \(\textbf{v}_i\) is a vector of features. In a physical system of particles, one might represent \(V\) as a set of individual particles’ attributes, like mass, position, and velocity, with edges expressing interactions, such as forces, between particles.</p> <blockquote> <p>Graphs are a really general way to think about arbitrary data representation. For instance, images can be thought of as nodes (pixels) arranged on a 2D lattice (regularly-spaced edges).</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="dark-matter-halo-graphs-from-catalogues">Dark Matter Halo Graphs from Catalogues</h2> <p>To create a graph from a catalogue of dark matter halos (or galaxy clusters), we need to define two physical parameters:</p> <ol> <li>a mass cut, \(M_{\rm cut}\)</li> <li>a connection radius, \(r_{\rm connect}\)</li> </ol> <p>We trunctate a catalogue to halos with a minumum mass \(M_{\rm cut}\). We’ll then connect all remaining halos to all other halos within a radius of \(r_{\rm connect}\). In Figure 5, the dark points are halos with \(M_{\rm cut}=1.5\times10^{15} M_{\rm sun}\), while light points are halos with masses \(M_i &gt; M_{\rm cut}=1.1\times10^{15} M_{\rm sun}\).</p> <figure class="align-center"> <p align="center"> <img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/b8ICuMdjg37vQNjwTA/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611da6738a8551bc2d92f2eb821b6d853092aa22ca9&amp;rid=giphy.gif" alt="drawing" style="width:70%"/> <div class="caption"> <b> Figure 3 </b> - Graphs are assembled by making a mass cut.

The output of the IMNN, unlike <em>regression</em> neural networks, is not a label. IMNN training is explicitly <em>unsupervised</em>, so the outputs of the network are somewhat arbitrary numbers (the value of the score of the underlying implicit likelihood). However, these numbers exist in a <a href="#simulation-based-inference-how-to-use-gimnns-in-practice">small subspace</a> that can be exploited for comparing compressed simulations to one another for simulation-based inference.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you’re curious, the details behind the IMNN algorithm <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03537">can be found here on arxiv</a>.</p> <h2 id="graph-neural-networks">Graph Neural Networks</h2> <p>How do graph neural networks (GNNs) work under the hood ? GNNs have been the buzz for a while in the machine learning community. We use a generic GNN block (neural updates for edges, nodes, and globals), described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261">this paper</a>, but we’ll go over the basic algorithm here.</p> <p>A graph neural network (GNN) block typically consists of three update functions, \(\boldsymbol{\phi}=(\phi_u, \phi_v, \phi_e)\), and three aggregation functions, \(\boldsymbol{\rho} =(\rho^u, \rho^v, \rho^e)\), applied sequentially to a graph tuple \(G = (\textbf{u}, V, E)\). A single graph block $\ell$ is comprised of several update steps to its elements:</p> <ol> <li> <p><em>Edge update</em>: Each edge is parameterized by a function \(\phi^{\ell+1}_e\) which takes as inputs its connected nodes, previous value, and graph global properties and yields another edge: \(\textbf{e}_{ij}^{\ell + 1} = \phi^{\ell + 1}_e(\textbf{v}_i^\ell, \textbf{v}{j}^\ell, \textbf{e}_{ij}^\ell \textbf{u}^\ell),\) where \(\textbf{v}_{i}^\ell\) and \(\textbf{v}_{j}^\ell\) are sender and receiver nodes indexed by \((s_k, r_k)\).</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Node update</em>: Each node is then parameterized by a function \(\phi^{\ell + 1}_v\) and outputs a new node: \(\textbf{v}i^{\ell + 1} = \phi^{\ell+1}_v \left(\rho^{e \rightarrow v}(E_i^{\ell + 1}), \textbf{v}i^\ell, \textbf{u}^\ell \right),\) Here a permutation-invariant aggregation operation \(\rho^{e \rightarrow v}(E_i^{\ell + 1})\) pools the neighbourhood of edges \(E^{\ell + 1}_i\) connected to node $i$ into a fixed-sized vector to feed into the update function.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Global update</em>: The global features of the graph are then updated with a function \(\phi^{\ell + 1}_u\): \(\textbf{u}^{\ell + 1} = \phi^u\left(\rho^{e\rightarrow v}(E^{\ell + 1}), \rho^{v \rightarrow u}(V^{\ell + 1}), \textbf{u}^\ell \right),\) where the graph’s edge (\(E^{\ell+1}\)) and node (\(V^{\ell+1}\)) sets are pooled into fixed-sized vectors for the global update.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The \(\boldsymbol{\phi}\) functions can be arbitrarily parameterized by neural networks, meaning we can nonlinearly pull out information from edges and node features. Furthermore, by allowing edges to propagate information to the nodes they connect, we can extract information from relevant neighborhoods of structure. The aggregation functions \(\boldsymbol{\rho}\) allow us to pool information over differently-sized graph features – this is super handy when your data size changes with cosmology !</p> <p>Stacking \(\ell = 1:N^{\rm int}\) GNN blocks allows node information to be propagated to and from neighbours \(N^{\rm int}\) degrees away, where \(\textrm{int}\) refers to <em>interactions</em>. In this work all GNN blocks operate over the entire graph.</p> <p>Graph neural networks fit nicely into the IMNN formalism. We can stack \(N^{\rm interaction}\) GNN blocks to extract information from clusters and edges in the graph, and finally aggregate that information into graph “globals”, in this case the set of gIMNN summaries are the global properties of the graph, \(\textbf{u} = \textbf{x}\). We can then use these summaries to optimize our Fisher calculation using backpropagation !</p> <h2 id="constraining-omega_m--sigma_8-in-the-imnn-formalism">Constraining \(\Omega_m\) &amp; \(\sigma_8\) in the IMNN formalism</h2> <p>Now we have all the tools to start extracting cosmological information from LSS assembled as a graph. We’re going to use the <em>Quijote</em> simulations to see how sensitive the cosmic graph is to the cosmological parameters \(\Omega_m\) (the matter fraction parameter) and \(\sigma_8\) (the parameter that controls fluctuations or “peakiness” in the density field).</p> <p>The <em>Quijote</em> simulation suite is designed for Fisher analyses. It is comprised of massive dark matter structure simulations on \((1 \rm Gpc)^3\) boxes (1 Gpc = 3261564220 light years !). These density fields are then used to assemble <em>halo catalogues</em> by using the Friend-of-Friends clustering algorithm.</p> <p>We’re going to use:</p> <ul> <li> <p>500 catalogue simulations at \(\boldsymbol{\vartheta}_{\rm fid} = (\Omega_m, \sigma_8) = (0.3175, 0.834)\) to estimate the covariance of the network outputs</p> </li> <li> <p>250 \(\times 4\) catalogue simulations at \(\boldsymbol{\vartheta}^{\pm} = \boldsymbol{\vartheta}_{\rm fid} \pm (0.01, 0.015) = \begin{bmatrix} \Omega^-_{m} &amp; \sigma^{\rm fid}_8\\ \Omega^{\rm fid}_m &amp; \sigma_8^- \\ \Omega^+_m &amp; \sigma^{\rm fid}_8 \\ \Omega^{\rm fid}_m &amp; \sigma_8^+ \end{bmatrix}\) to estimate the derivatives of the output of the network.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The <em>Quijote</em> suite contains enough universe simulations to make an equally-sized training and validation set of graphs to compute the Fisher statistics. The validation set is important such that the GNNs learn patterns such that they can generalise to unseen data.</p> <p>We built the IMNN and simulation scheme in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jax</code> framework.

The form of \(f(\sigma; \vartheta)\) can be related analytically to cosmological parameters or approximated using simulations.</p> <p>If we rearrange the above equation for \(f(\sigma)\), we obtain</p> \[\begin{equation} f(\sigma) = \frac{M}{\rho_o} \frac{dn(M)}{d \ln (\sigma^{-1}(M))}, \end{equation}\] <p>Integrating the halo number density from a fixed mass \(M_{\rm cut}\) yields the number of halos with a mass above this threshold:</p> \[\begin{equation} N(M_i &gt; M_{\rm cut}) = \int_{M_{\rm cut}}^\infty \frac{dn}{dM} dM, \end{equation}\] <p>which in our case is the node cardinality of a halo graph, \(N^v\). By contrast, integrating the halo mass function from \(M_{\rm cut}\) yields the <em>fraction of total mass</em> residing in collapsed halos of mass above \(M_{\rm cut}\):</p> \[\begin{equation} F(M_i &gt; M_{\rm cut}) = \int_{M_{\rm cut}}^\infty f(\sigma) dM, \end{equation}\] <p>which incorporates <em>both</em> halo number \(N^v\) and mass information above \(M_{\rm cut}\).</p> <p>When graphs <em>aren’t</em> decorated with masses, the Fisher ellipse (green) rotates towards the <em>number density</em> contours (dashed lines) \(N(M_i &gt; M_{\rm cut})\), since this is the information the network receives: the number of halos above the mass cut.</p> <p>When we do specify masses, we see the Fisher (black) aligned with the integrated <em>halo mass</em> fraction lines (black lines) – our network has learned this concept automatically !</p> <h1 id="part-iii-a-more-realistic-case-adding-survey-noise">Part III: A more realistic case: adding survey noise</h1> <p>Now that we know the raw information content of the graph structure, we can see if gIMNNs would be useful for catalogues assembled with <em>noisy</em> halo or galaxy masses. Here we introduce a white noise model to the halo masses <em>before</em> making a catalogue cut at \(M_{\rm cut}\): \(\begin{equation} \hat{m}_i = m_i + \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_{\rm noise}), \end{equation}\) where \(\sigma_{\rm noise}=A_{\rm noise}M_{\rm cut}\) with amplitude \(A_{\rm noise}\). Observed halos that fall below \(M_{\rm cut}\) are then trimmed from the graph to mimic real catalogue cuts in the presence of noisy mass estimates. We can think of this as a likelihood for a halo finder operating on noisy galaxy mass or luminosity measurements.</p> <figure class="align-center"> <p align="center"> <img src="/assets/img/cosmographs/masscut.png" alt="drawing" width="65%"/> <div class="caption"> <b> Figure 10 </b> - Mass distribution after added noise, $\sigma_{\rm noise}=0.2 M_{\rm cut}$ (black) and simulated halo finder cuts (teal) for a single fiducial simulation for masses larger than $1.1 \times 10^{15}\ M_\odot$.

Intuitively we’d expect the Fisher information estimate to fluctuate more as the lowest-mass halos in the survey become dominated by noise. More noise also means that the catalogue data becomes <em>less informative about the cosmology</em>, so the Fisher information drops slightly for the higher-noise cases. We term this <em>information leakage</em>, resulting in higher uncertainty contours in the Fisher plot:</p> <figure class="align-center"> <p align="center"> <img src="/assets/img/cosmographs/F_vary_mass_intfsigma.png" alt="drawing" width="65%"/> <div class="caption"> <b> Figure 12 </b> - Fisher constraints for different noise models, plotted over lines of the Press-Schechter halo mass function. </div> </p> </figure> <p>We also plot the HMF lines for comparison and see that as the mass information becomes muddied by noise, the Fisher also <em>tilts away</em> from the HMF line alignment that we observe in the no-noise case (orange).</p> <h1 id="simulation-based-inference-how-to-use-gimnns-in-practice">Simulation-based Inference: How to use gIMNNs in Practice</h1> <p>This is largely an exploratory study to elucidate the information in cosmological catalogues by expressing the data as graphs. Along the way, however, we developed a technology that allows us to compress catalogues into neural summaries, \(\textbf{x}\). We can then compare simulated catalogues at different values of \(\theta\) to an actual dataset and accept-or-reject the simulations to build a posterior distribution. This scheme is called <em>Approximate Bayesian Computation</em> (ABC), and can be expensive for uninformative summary statistics. An even smarter approach is to use another set of neural networks to parameterize a posterior density. This technique, called Density Estimation Likelihood-Free Inference (DELFI), is what we used for our neural summaries in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07405">this paper</a>.</p> <h1 id="related-work">Related Work</h1> <p><strong>Neural Field-Level Information Extraction.</strong> This project is similar in style to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07405">field-level Information Maximising Neural Networks</a>. Both works aim to extract cosmological information from LSS. However, in our field-level study we assumed that we had access to the full density field image of a log-normal LSS simulation. We computed the analytic Fisher information for this field and showed that IMNNs with a CNN architecture can saturate the field-level information content–equivalent to writing a likelihood for every single pixel in the image ! We can think of the graph representation as a way to extract cosmological information when we don’t have a complete image of the underlying density field. Alternatively, we can think of images as 2D graphs bound to a lattice !</p> <h1 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h1> <p>In this study we investigated how much cosmological information is locked away in dark matter halo catalogues. To do this, we exploited the flexibility and symmetric properties of graphs to efficiently compress massive simulations down to a couple of numbers using graph neural networks.</p> <p>The language of graphs is an elegant way to describe the unintuitive nature of large-scale structure. Equipped with the technology of graph neural networks and a rigorous stastical metric (the Fisher information), we were able to cast cosmology as an optimization problem and find a way to squeeze more information out of catalogues than traditional statistics. We worked with really small catalogues, but demonstrated that even these structures are very sensitive to cosmology.</p> <p>We introduced new vocabulary with which to describe the cosmic web, and incorporated graph learning in the context of cosmological statistics. The extensions to this work are numerous, both within and outside of cosmology.</p>]]></content><author><name>T.
